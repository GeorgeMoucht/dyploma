# Abstracts

The 'abstracts/' directory gathers all the Sass tools and helpers that the project use across all pages. Every global variable, function, mixin and placeholder should be put in here.

The rule of thumb is that should not output a single line of CSS when compiled on its own. These are nothing but Sass helpers.
