# Pages

If you have page-specific styles, it is better to put this styles into 'pages/' directory. For instance, it's not uncommon to have very specific styles for the home page hence the need for a '_home.scss' file in 'pages/'.

Note - Depending on your deployment process, these files could be called on their own to avoid merging them with the others in the resulting stylesheet. It is really op to you.
